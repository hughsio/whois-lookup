# Welcome to My Domain Inquiry Toolkit

## A Personal Introduction
Hi there! I'm excited to share with you a little project of mine: the Domain Inquiry Toolkit. It's a Python script I've been tinkering with that delves into the world of domain registrations. I've crafted it to help curious minds like you and me uncover the age of domains and peek into their registration details.

## Setting Up
First things first, we need to get our environment ready. I've used the `python-whois` library to gather all the juicy details of a domain. You can join in on the fun by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install python-whois
```

## What My Toolkit Can Do
I've put together a few features in this toolkit that I think you'll find quite handy:

1. **Finding Out How Old a Domain Is:**
   - I can tell you the age of any domain in days. It's like knowing the exact number of candles on a website's birthday cake!

2. **Age in Years and Months:**
   - If you prefer a broader view, I can break down a domain's age into years and months for you.

3. **Is This Domain Taken? Plus WHOIS Info:**
   - Ever wonder if a domain name is already taken? I can check that for you and if it is, I'll pull up all its WHOIS info like a digital detective.

## How to Use My Creation
Just run the script, and when I ask for a domain name, type it in. I'll handle the rest and present you with the information in a clear and friendly manner.

## The Experimental Side
Keep in mind, this toolkit is my playground. It's where I experiment and learn. The way I calculate the domain's age is a bit rough around the edges â€“ I haven't quite mastered the art of accounting for leap years or different month lengths just yet.

## Your Thoughts Matter
Since this is a work in progress, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Your feedback is like a compass guiding me towards improvement.

## A Word of Caution
Please remember, the information from this toolkit is for exploratory purposes only. It's not the gospel truth, so let's not use it to make any big domain-related decisions, okay?

## Sharing Is Caring
I believe in open-source, so I'm sharing this project under the MIT License. Feel free to use it, tweak it, and make it your own.
